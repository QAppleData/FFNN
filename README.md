# FFNN
A single hidden layer feedfoward neural network model is created by Pytorch.
I did it following the instruction from DataCamp. 
I tried out several different combinations of parameters.
I would like to try grid search but not sure how. 
I tried to use SKorch and Sk-learn to preform grid search, but the dataloader in pytorch word differently than Sklearn.dataset...
